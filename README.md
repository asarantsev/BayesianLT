This is code and data for my article: 
A Note on New Valuation Measures for Standard & Poor Composite Index Returns,
co-authored with Taran Grove and Michael Reyes. See arXiv:1905.04603.
See code9.py for code and Data.xlsx for data.
Old code versions include version1.py and version2.py. Now you can ignore them.
